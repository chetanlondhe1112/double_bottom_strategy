Double botton scan daily program change

- modify double bottom scan program to store trade_token along with scanned stocks
use this logic 
df["stock_id"] = df["stock_id"] + "-EQ"
url = 'https://margincalculator.angelbroking.com/OpenAPI_File/files/OpenAPIScripMaster.json'
d = requests.get(url).json()
token_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(d)

for i in range(len(df)):
    # Find the matching token value in the second dataframe based on stock_id
    token_value = token_df[token_df['symbol'] == df.at[i, 'stock_id']]['token'].values[0]
    
    # Assign the token value to the corresponding row in the first dataframe
    df.at[i, 'trade_token'] = token_value

to calculate the trade token and store in db table along with the stocks list. You will need to use the trade token while placing the order

For each stock in scanned stocks
